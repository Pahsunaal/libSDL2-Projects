# Mini2DEngine

This project is a simple 2D game engine for SDL2 that I can use to create a variety of different games. I will be adding to it slowly as I learn more about engines and C++. Generally, I will be making most improvements in a game first, then porting them over here. In a sense, I'll be using this as a template for future games.

## ASTEROIDS

Enough features have been added that I was able to create my first game using this engine! It acts as the demonstration game for the engine itself. Based on the arcade classic Asteroids, the aim is to get to 1000 points by breaking up asteroids whilst avoiding them.

Simply download the .ZIP file, extract it, and run the .exe.
