# Mini2DEngine

This project is a simple 2D game engine for SDL2 that I can use to create a variety of different games. I will be adding to it slowly as I learn more about engines and C++. Generally, I will be making most improvements in a game first, then porting them over here. In a sense, I'll be using this as a template for future games.
