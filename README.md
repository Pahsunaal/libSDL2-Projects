# libSDL2 Projects

This repository contains a collection of my practice C++ game design projects, specifically those using the SDL2 libraries, which can be found here: https://www.libsdl.org/. Most of these projects were created to practice using C++ to create games, and so will focus on specific skills such as sprite management of player input.
